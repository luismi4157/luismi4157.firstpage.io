I declare that the following source code was written by me, or provided
by the instructor for this project. I understand that copying source
code from any other source, providing source code to another student, 
or leaving my code on a public web site constitutes cheating.
I acknowledge that  If I am found in violation of this policy this may result
in a zero grade, a permanent record on file and possibly immediate failure of the class.
 
Reflection (1-2 paragraphs):  This is the first website I've built, and it was fun doing so. It was a bit annoying to build the table
at first, but I got used to it pretty quick. I feel like the extra items was the most beneficial part of the project, because it made me
do research on what I needed to implement.

                        <p>The MT-03 has a low seat height of 780 mm. This creates confidence in newer and shorter riders concerned with getting their feet on the ground when coming to a stop. 
                        Additionally, the MT-03 is a featherweight at 168 kg, so it’s easy to manage. The upswept handlebar puts the rider in an upright body position that offers a strong sense of 
                        control and a clear vantage point for navigating traffic.</p>

                        <p>One bad experience from too much power can scare a new rider away from motorcycling entirely, which is why the MT-03 uses a friendly 321 cc inline twin-cylinder motor 
                            derived from the popular YZF-R3. It’s easy to control at low speeds yet provides plenty of zip for the highway or joyriding in the countryside. Fuel injection equals a 
                            smooth throttle that takes some of the intimidation out of learning to ride. I can asure you, you won't be able to accidentaly pull a whilie.</p>

                            <p>The MT-03 is based on the popular YZF-R3, a model that has introduced thousands of Canadians to motorcycling. Designers removed the R3’s sport bike bodywork, creating a 
                                “naked” bike (sometimes called a roadster or standard bike), with minimal body panels and an exposed engine. The MT-03’s angular, Japanese-inspired design can be found on 
                                other models in the Yamaha MT series (MT-10, MT-09 and MT-07), giving it big-bike looks in a friendly package. And check out that cool headlight design!</p>

                            <p>Everybody thinks it’s cool to have a vintage bike, and maybe the purchase price was right, but caveat emptor! The first time you suffer a mechanical issue that you can’t 
                                diagnose, it can make you feel like motorcycling just isn’t for you after all. Owning a brand-new bike removes layers of stress from the riding experience and minimizes the
                                risk of major repairs.</p>
                            <p>The MT-03 is infused with Yamaha’s trademark reliability, plus a one-year warranty and a dealer network that spreads across Canada, from urban centres to small towns. 
                                You deserve years of stress-free riding!</p>

                            <p>With a starting MSRP of $5,899, the 2021 MT-03 is one of the best-priced introductory bikes on the market. And, unlike that guy on Kijiji who needs cash on the spot 
                                for a bike you’re not 100% sure about, you can finance your new MT at the dealership with Yamaha Financial Services. Walking out the door with low payments and a 
                                strong warranty—and your brand-new bike—will let you simply focus on the joy of riding. And that’s what motorcycling is all about.</p>
