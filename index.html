I declare that the following source code was written by me, or provided
by the instructor for this project. I understand that copying source
code from any other source, providing source code to another student, 
or leaving my code on a public web site constitutes cheating.
I acknowledge that  If I am found in violation of this policy this may result
in a zero grade, a permanent record on file and possibly immediate failure of the class.
 
Reflection (1-2 paragraphs):  This is the first website I've built, and it was fun doing so. It was a bit annoying to build the table
at first, but I got used to it pretty quick. I feel like the extra items was the most beneficial part of the project, because it made me
do research on what I needed to implement.

                    <h1 id="pageTitle">Yamaha MT-03: One of the best motorcycles for begginers</h1>
                    <p>Need to add a paragraph</p>
                    <h2 id="difficulty">Difficulty</h2>
                    <p>The MT-03 has a low seat height of 780 mm. This creates confidence in newer and shorter riders concerned with getting their feet on the ground when coming to a stop. 
                    Additionally, the MT-03 is a featherweight at 168 kg, so it’s easy to manage. The upswept handlebar puts the rider in an upright body position that offers a strong sense of 
                    control and a clear vantage point for navigating traffic.</p>
                    <h2 id="power">Power</h2>
                    <p>One bad experience from too much power can scare a new rider away from motorcycling entirely, which is why the MT-03 uses a friendly 321 cc inline twin-cylinder motor 
                        derived from the popular YZF-R3. It’s easy to control at low speeds yet provides plenty of zip for the highway or joyriding in the countryside. Fuel injection equals a 
                        smooth throttle that takes some of the intimidation out of learning to ride.</p>
                    <h2 id="style">Style</h2>
                    <p>The MT-03 is based on the popular YZF-R3, a model that has introduced thousands of Canadians to motorcycling. Designers removed the R3’s sport bike bodywork, creating a 
                        “naked” bike (sometimes called a roadster or standard bike), with minimal body panels and an exposed engine. The MT-03’s angular, Japanese-inspired design can be found on 
                        other models in the Yamaha MT series (MT-10, MT-09 and MT-07), giving it big-bike looks in a friendly package. And check out that cool headlight design!</p>
