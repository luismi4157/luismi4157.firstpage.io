        <h2>A Haiku I wrote</h2>
        Inspired by my kids, who bring me joy every day: <br>Saturday morning, <br>a time to rest in silence <br>"Wake up!" my kids yell.
        <h2>My Interests</h2>
        <p>I like motorcycles. I started riding last summer, and I’ve enjoyed it a lot. What I like the most about riding are the twisties. 
           <br>I’m always a bit scared about going on rides with my buddies up the canyon, but once I get there, all my worries go away. </p>
        <p>I also enjoy playing video games. I don’t have much time right now, but when I do, I play Final Fantasy XlV. I also like first 
            <br>person shooters and single player story games. I’m looking forward to Hogwarts Legacy coming out next month. </p>
        <p>I had never shot a gun until I came to Utah in 2016. I quickly realized how much I enjoyed it. I’ve shot handguns, revolvers, 
           <br>riffles, and shotguns, but what I’ve come to enjoy the most is clay pigeon shooting. </p>
