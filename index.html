I declare that the following source code was written by me, or provided
by the instructor for this project. I understand that copying source
code from any other source, providing source code to another student, 
or leaving my code on a public web site constitutes cheating.
I acknowledge that  If I am found in violation of this policy this may result
in a zero grade, a permanent record on file and possibly immediate failure of the class.
 
Reflection (1-2 paragraphs):  This is the first website I've built, and it was fun doing so. It was a bit annoying to build the table
at first, but I got used to it pretty quick. I feel like the extra items was the most beneficial part of the project, because it made me
do research on what I needed to implement.
